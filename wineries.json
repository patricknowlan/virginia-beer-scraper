That's literally where you'll be when you visit Chester Gap Cellars at the northern tip of beautiful Rappahannock County, enjoying not only stunning views from the Cellar's open-air tasting patio but truly great, hand-crafted wines.At over 1,000 feet elevation but conveniently located just off of Route 522, near Front Royal and I-66, the Cellars is a prime destination for day trippers or weekenders seeking a tranquil, intimate, friendly place to put their feet up, taste through Bernd Jung's estate-grown Viognier, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and innovative blends, and let their eyes feast on lovingly tended vines and the endless blue mountains and hills of the southeast Piedmont.What is the wine all about at Chester Gap Cellars? The Jung family's commitment to growing the highest quality grapes and Bernd's commitment to capturing the full flavor of that quality through minimal intervention. High elevation, an eastern exposure, well-drained rocky soils, nearly frost-free conditions, and cooler summer days and nights all add up to grapes that can hang in the vineyard until optimal ripeness is achieved.The result? Well, come taste for yourself.Directions: From Front Royal, take Rt. 522S for 5 miles, then left at Chester Gap Cellars, across from the Chester Gap turn-off for Rt. 665.From Warrenton, take 211 W for 18 miles, then turn right on 522N, coming through the village of Flint Hill, for 10 miles.  Turn right at Chester Gap Cellars, across from the Chester Gap turn-off for Rt. 665.",

        "description": "Located just off U.S. 29 on Rt. 718 in gorgeous Nelson County, Democracy Vineyards' architecturally dramatic tasting room is open Saturday through Monday from April until Thanksgiving weekend. Hours are 1PM - 6PM.  Once a vibrant apple operation, six varieties of grapes are now under cultivation.  Destined to be a true Virginia Farm winery, Democracy Vineyards features ten award winning wines, including varietals and blends, dry and sweet.The founders of Democracy Vineyards, Susan Prokop and Jim Turpin, started with just an idea, a notion of a Virginia farm winery where they could start their encore career as Virginia winegrowers.At an elevation between 800 and 1,000 feet the Vineyards are located to the south side of Rt 718.Noted Virginia Viticulturalist Chris Hill assisted with the establishment of Democracy Vineyards.  By design, the rows are set to run North/South to take advantage of the prevailing wind patterns and to provide the greatest sun exposure to the fruit in the summer months.  The alignment also provides easy tractor and worker access to the vines.Democracy Vineyards is appropriately located in the richest part of Virginia’s wine country the Monticello American Viticultural Area.  According to the Jeffersonian Grape Growers Society:\"The wineries of the Monticello appellation fulfill a vision of Thomas Jefferson, whose aim was to produce exceptional quality wines like those he had tasted on his travels to Europe.  Today, 500 acres of vitis vinifera vineyards surround Jefferson's historic Monticello estate.  In just over two decades, the wine industry in the Charlottesville area has flourished, achieving national and international acclaim.  Within the boundaries of this federally designated area are twenty-one farm wineries, the largest concentration of such in Virginia.\"Our goal is to work with the land to grow excellent wines from the ground up.  Democracy Vineyards is committed to building a sustainable farming operation to enhance the farm and promote agritourism in the region.",

The port styled dessert wine served with Virginia made chocolate is the highlight of the tasting line-up which includes eight or ten wines.  The tasting bar is also a treat as it includes money from around the world where the owners have lived or traveled.

Owners Dean and Nancy Vanhuss, with their daughter Michelle Pizzarello, have carefully restored it, using nearly all of the original wood to keep the spirit of the stable intact and give the winery a distinct rustic feel. Exposed wood beams, a tin roof, sconces, and a fireplace give the winery an updated and warm feeling. The original large wooden storm shutters now slide past the winery's French doors, and the loft has two balconies overlooking the attractive grounds. The patio seats up to 30 people for wine tasting and light fare.  For Dean Vanhuss, winemaking is a retirement venture after a career in technology. He has been growing grapes in Loudoun since the late 1990s and currently has six acres planted, most at Short Hill Vineyards, their home in Lovettsville.Owner: Dean & Nancy Vanhuss and Michelle PizzarelloWinemakers: Dean Vanhuss, Karen Reed",

        "description": "After a 35 year career of service to our nation, Paul Greenwood returned home to his native Halifax County family farm and became a sixth generation farmer on his 84 acre property.  The vineyard was planted in the spring of 2004 and Greenwood Vineyards started with 1600 vines, consisting of  Sangiovese, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc grapes.  In 2007 another 1215 vines were planted, expanding our line of Sangiovese and Merlot grapes and adding Chardonnay.Greenwood Vineyards started as a vineyard that was supplying excellent quality grapes to other wineries.  These included Rebec Winery in Amherst, Virginia;  Molliver Vineyards in Natalie, Virginia and Hunting Creek Vineyards in Clover, Virginia.  After much encouragement from our friends Milt and Sandy McPherson of Hunting Creek Vineyards, Boyd and Shirley Archer of Bright Meadows Farm,  and Bill and Jane Carlton Confroy, fellow vineyard owners, Greenwood Vineyards & Winery was started in 2010.The winery is located in a 145 year old former tobacco packing barn that has been completely restored by the owner.  The old barn has a tasting room, wine storage facility, a production room, and a primary fermentation room.  In addition, it has an underground wine cellar that is reached by a circular stairway.  A large room above the tasting room is available for private parties and events.Our grand opening was September 17, 2010 with a festival we hosted for the Halifax Village Business Association.  This festival, called ”Soiree in the Hills”,  was a huge success for both Greenwood Vineyards and the business association.  Our second annual “Soiree in the Hills” was held on September 16, 2011 and was another successful festival for both Greenwood Vineyards and the Halifax Village Business Association.",

Nearby are the birthplaces of George Washington, James Monroe and Robert E. Lee. This historic estate has been owned by the Flemer family for over one hundred years. Charles H. Flemer purchased Ingleside in 1890, and today one of his great-great grandsons is proprietor of Ingleside Vineyards, Doug Flemer.The winery is housed in the plantation's former dairy barns. The first commercial wines were produced in 1980 and were made from hand-harvested grapes grown in the vineyards. Ingleside wines are produced in the same way they are produced today and have consistently earned top honors in state, national, and international wine competitions.Virginia's Northern Neck is a peninsula formed by the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers. They are tributaries of the majestic Chesapeake Bay. The Bay is a major factor in creating a stable climate fundamental to grow top-quality vines. The vineyards cover about 50 acres of gently rolling and well-drained countryside.Visitors can enjoy a leisurely tour and tasting, as well as a visit to the Ingleside museum, which showcases local and natural history. Bring a picnic lunch to enjoy in the European-style courtyard. Frequent wine events, including a summer music series, bring together wine lovers from throughout the region. The Ingleside Estate Club offers benefits such as preferred pricing, member-only events, access to archive wines and more.Ingleside also offers two delightful guest cottages, which may be reserved for overnight stays.",

        "description": "Thomas Jefferson brokered the sale of our land to a Florentine Viticulturilist, Filippo Mazzei, inviting him to become his neighbor and to help in realizing Jefferson’s dream for the native production of wine in Virginia. First plantings of European vinifera varieties were in 1774 – in full view of Monticello. Unfortunately the Revolutionary War interrupted this venture and it was not until 1981 that planting vineyards here again regained favor.Thirty six years ago, we introduced quality modern viticulture to Virginia, helping realize Jefferson’s dream. Our winery offers select wines of superior quality and is considered to have “one of the region’s most consistent track records” (Wine Spectator).The wines we offer you are entirely of Virginia. The grapes are grown here on our property and in two select sites across the Commonwealth. We do not buy fruit from outside Virginia, nor do we use any commercial concentrates or additives to intensify our wines. These choices are consistent with our values, and we believe they are true to Jefferson's original vision of winemaking in Virginia. Further, we believe these choices create a better bottle of wine.We are located between two presidential homes (Monticello and Ash Lawn Highland) and are the closest winery to Charlottesville.",

Originally from Michigan, the Schornbergs chose Virginia to pursue their dream of owning a vineyard after an extensive search that spanned coast to coast.  Al recalls his grandfather’s stories of working at his uncle’s winery, Massena Cellars in France, and like his predecessor, his goal was straightforward: “I just wanted to be able to enjoy a really good wine that I made. There’s something very natural and satisfying about that.”  With their first vintage in 2002 winning the honor of \"Best White Wine in America\" at the Atlanta International Wine Summit, the Schornbergs knew they had made the right decision and set out to prove Virginia could also produce award-winning reds.  In 2009 they were awarded the Virginia Governor's Cup for their 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon, further transforming their dream into a reality.  Now, in 2016 Keswick Vineyards received their second Virginia Governor's Cup for their 2014 Cabernet Franc Reserve.  The Schornbergs are humbled and excited that their vision has evolved into a world-class vineyard and winery, with each year's vintage better than the last.

Unlike many larger producers, we don’t add sugar or water to our ciders. Our process is respectful of a long Virginia tradition but we are not afraid to push boundaries to make ciders that stand out.Our tasting room is located inside The Bridge PAI, a non-profit art organization, located in Belmont, south of downtown Charlottesville.

        "description": "There have been a lot of newcomers to Virginia wine over the last few decades and while Reynard Florence is only a few years old, founders and proprietors  Roe and Dee Allison are no strangers to the rolling hills of the Blue Ridge. The two, purchased the land where Reynard Florence is located shortly after they were married in 1976. Roe and Dee built their house in 1980 which overlooks the vineyard today. The couple raised their two sons, who also attended local schools, in that home. Instilled with a firm belief in maximizing the land's potential, Roe and Dee began planning a vineyard on the land where they had built their lives. Breaking ground in April '06 with only one half acre Petit Manseng vines, Reynard Florence has since expanded to include over 2 acres of Grenache, Petit Verdot, and Merlot. Under the direction of veteran vineyard consultant Chris Hill and winemaker Michael Shaps, Reynard Florence’s premier vintage in 2009 of Petit Manseng reflected not only the Allison’s love for the region, but also the care that went into the vineyard’s design and vine maintenance.",

Our waterfront view overlooks Turkey Island, home to the Presquile National Wildlife Refuge.Established in 2013, our estate grown grapes enjoy river breezes and the deep Pamunkey soil of the Tidewater region. Today we have 16 acres under vine and plans to expand. Our European varieties, vitis vinifera, were diligently selected to match our terroir and include:Petit Verdot, a Bordeaux red grape valued for its spice and tannin in a blending role, has now become a successful single varietal here in Virginia.Viognier, a Rhone Valley white grape, the official Virginia grape, has wonderful aromas of peach and pear.Merlot, another of the 5 Bordeaux red grapes, ripens early and is softer in tannin than its blending partners.Tannat, a lesser known Basque red grape, is now making some of the most impressive wines in Virginia.",

        "description": "Founded in 2000, Veramar Vineyard was one of the first successful wineries in the northern Shenandoah Valley. The vineyard is run by James and Della Bogaty, who were original members of the Shenandoah Valley Wine Trail. Justin, their son, is the winemaker. He is a graduate of VMI and has a certificate of oenology from UC Davis. Our wine is internationally-acclaimed, and is made at the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.Veramar Vineyard is located of Rt 7 in the northern Shenandoah Valley AVA of Virginia. Right over the Blue Ridge Mountains from Loudoun County, Veramar is a short drive from Leesburg or Winchester, and easily accessible from Washington, DC, Northern Virginia, Frederick, MD, Harpers Ferry, WV, and the Interstate 81 corridor.This hidden gem, nestled in the rolling hills near the Shenandoah River, has an expansive views of the mountains from the 28 acres of vineyards and the rustic yet elegant tasting room and terrace. In this idyllic setting we grow Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Seyval Blanc, Traminette, Norton, Albariño, Vidal Blanc and Malbec wine grapes, and make Virginian wine across a spectrum of varietals and blends. Each wine distinctively expresses our dedication to premium Virginia winemaking.The Bogaty family founded Veramar in 2000, when there were very few wineries operating successfully in this part of the state. Since then, the business has grown to include their son, Justin Bogaty, as winemaker, and there has certainly been a tremendous boom in the Virginian wine industry since then, especially in Loudoun County. But over the years we have never lost our values of family and sustainability - every aspect of Veramar, from the vineyard to the winemaking itself, is managed with the goal of creating a family business that can be passed down to many generations of Bogatys to come. We strive to be grounded enough to forego trends and fads in favor of the lasting principles that will sustain Veramar and Shenandoah Valley winemaking culture many years into the future.Our tasting room is open year-round, seven days a week, and opens daily at noon. The estate and vineyards are also the perfect setting for an elegant winery wedding or private party, a venue perfectly situated near Northern Virginia, Winchester, VA, and Washington, DC. We hope you'll visit us, and experience everything that premium Virginian wine has to offer!",
